# Quote the owner of the code
- Please note that the code in deployEKS has been forked from Yolean/kubernetes-kafka.
- Thank you Yolean for the detailed instructions and sample code. This has a good reference on how to build a Kafka cluster 

# Repo Structure
- BuildEKSStructure builds an EKS cluster in AWS through a Jenkins job (Refer the Readme.md in the BuildEKS folder)
- DeployKafkaToEKS deploys the Kafka on EKS


# Kafka on EKS
Quikstart to create a simple kafka setup 
- kubectl create namespace kafka && \
- cd /DeployKafkaEKS/variants/dev-small
- kubectl apply -k /DeployKafkaEKS/variants/dev-small/variants/dev-small/?ref=v6.0.3

# Points to note on Kafka setup
- Zookeeper also needs to be packaged along with kafka as a seperate PoD 
- Anti Affinity is expected to be setup to ensure ZooKeeper and Kafka are spread across and dont end up in the same node
- Stateful set and Persistence through volumes also needs to setup to ensures the state of Kafka is preserved in a persistent 
database for situations when pod is destroyed and and has to be rebuilt by EKS
- The liveness (To check if container is running and needs a restart) & readiness (redy to recieve requests) aspect of the Pods needs to be considered as well

# Alternative solution
- Strinzi is https://strimzi.io/documentation/ is one more open source solution to get Kafka installed on Kubernetes
